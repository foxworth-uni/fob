# Welcome to Bunny Blog! 🐰

This is a demonstration of how to build a **blazing-fast** blog using:

- **Rust** - For performance and safety
- **Axum** - A modern web framework
- **Bunny** - A high-performance MDX compiler
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components

## Why Bunny?

Bunny is a Rust-based MDX compiler that offers:

1. **Performance** - Compiles MDX at lightning speed
2. **Safety** - Built with Rust's memory safety guarantees
3. **Standards** - Follows the MDX specification
4. **Flexibility** - Works with any Rust web framework

## Getting Started

To create your own blog post, simply create a new `.mdx` file in the `posts/` directory:

```mdx

# My First Post

Your content here!
```

## Features

This example demonstrates:

- **Frontmatter parsing** - Extract metadata from your posts
- **MDX compilation** - Convert MDX to JSX
- **Dynamic routing** - Serve posts at `/post/:slug`
- **Hot reloading** - Reload posts with the `/api/reload` endpoint

## What's Next?

In a production application, you might want to:

- Add a React/Preact renderer to convert JSX to HTML
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR)
- Add search functionality
- Integrate with a bundler like Rolldown
- Add RSS feed generation
- Implement pagination

Happy blogging! 🚀
