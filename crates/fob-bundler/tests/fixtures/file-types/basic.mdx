# Welcome to MDX

This is a **basic MDX test** file that combines:

- Markdown syntax
- YAML frontmatter
- JSX components (when imported)

## Features Tested

1. Headings with IDs
2. **Bold** and *italic* text
3. Lists (ordered and unordered)
4. Code blocks

```javascript
const hello = "world";
console.log(hello);
```

## Conclusion

MDX is great for documentation and content-rich pages.
